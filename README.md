Hey there, I'm a designer at Github. Working on social features for the developer community.

I'm all ears for anyone with ideas for new features or ways to improve Github.
You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anthny) whenever you'd like.

Non-work related things about me: I have lost count of how many tattoos I have, and my dog is named Trixie Mattel, yes, like the drag queen..
